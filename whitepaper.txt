## 1. INTRODUCTION: THE AUTHOR'S DILEMMA

### 1.1 The Current Landscape

The digital revolution promised authors unprecedented access to global audiences without traditional gatekeepers. Yet two decades into the 21st century, content creators find themselves caught between unsustainable models:

- **Traditional Publishing**: Offering legitimacy and distribution at the cost of creative control and diminished royalties (typically 8-15%)
- **Self-Publishing**: Providing creative freedom but requiring authors to become marketers, designers, and distributors with limited infrastructure
- **Platform Dependence**: Creating vulnerability to algorithm changes, censorship risks, and data exploitation by centralized platforms
- **Audience Fragmentation**: Forcing creators to maintain presence across numerous platforms with conflicting incentives

In this environment, authors face a difficult choice: surrender significant value and control to intermediaries or shoulder the entire burden of the publishing ecosystem alone.

### 1.2 The Data Ownership Problem

Beyond revenue models, a fundamental issue remains unaddressed: authors rarely own or control the data generated by their content. This includes:

- Reader analytics and engagement metrics
- Audience demographic information
- Content performance data
- Direct reader relationships
- Derivative content and AI training value

This data, often more valuable than the content itself, becomes siloed within platforms that monetize it without compensating creators. As AI systems increasingly train on authors' works, this inequity grows more pronounced.

### 1.3 The Web3 Opportunity

The emergence of blockchain technology, decentralized storage, and token economics presents a unique opportunity to redefine the relationship between authors, their works, and their audiences. By implementing a decentralized publishing ecosystem with transparent economics, PageDAO aims to solve the author's dilemma and create new possibilities for sustainable content creation.

```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│ Presentation Layer (React Frontend)│
└───────────┬───────────────────────┘
            │
┌───────────▼───────────────────────┐
│ API Layer (Netlify Functions)      │
└───────────┬───────────────────────┘
            │
┌───────────▼───────────────────────┐
│ Data Collection Layer              │
│ (Blockchain Connectors & Processors)│
└───────────┬───────────────────────┘
            │
┌───────────▼───────────────────────┐
│ Data Sources                       │
│ (Ethereum, Optimism, Base,        │
│  Osmosis, Arweave)                │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 5.3 Core Library (@pagedao/core)

At the heart of the PageDAO Hub lies the @pagedao/core library, providing essential functionality that can be reused across various applications and interfaces.

#### 5.3.1 Key Components

- **Blockchain Connectors**: Standardized interfaces for interacting with supported chains
- **Price Calculation Algorithms**: Accurate token pricing with liquidity weighting
- **TVL and Liquidity Analytics**: Comprehensive pool and market depth analysis
- **Historical Data Management**: Time-series storage and retrieval for trend analysis
- **Governance Interfaces**: Proposal creation, voting, and execution mechanisms

#### 5.3.2 Liquidity-Weighted Price Calculation

A distinguishing feature of the @pagedao/core library is its sophisticated approach to token valuation. Rather than using simple averages, the library implements a liquidity-weighted calculation that accounts for varying market depths across chains:

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates a liquidity-weighted average price across multiple markets
 * 
 * @param {Object} priceData - Object containing price by chain
 * @param {Object} liquidityData - Object containing TVL by chain
 * @param {Object} options - Optional configuration parameters
 * @returns {number} The liquidity-weighted average price
 */
function calculateWeightedPrice(priceData, liquidityData, options = {}) {
  // Filter chains based on options
  const chains = Object.keys(priceData)
    .filter(chain => !options.excludeChains?.includes(chain))
    .filter(chain => liquidityData[chain] >= (options.minLiquidityThreshold || 0));
  
  // Calculate total liquidity across all included chains
  const totalLiquidity = chains.reduce((sum, chain) => sum + liquidityData[chain], 0);
  
  // Calculate weighted average price
  return chains.reduce((weightedSum, chain) => {
    const weight = options.manualWeights?.[chain] || (liquidityData[chain] / totalLiquidity);
    return weightedSum + (priceData[chain] * weight);
  }, 0);
}
```

This approach ensures that the reported $PAGE price accurately reflects where most trading activity occurs, rather than giving equal weight to all markets regardless of size or liquidity.
