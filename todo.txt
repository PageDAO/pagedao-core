# PageDAO Hub Development Roadmap

## COMPLETED
- [x] Analyzed existing page-token-frame codebase for reuse
- [x] Identified core functionality for price and TVL calculations
- [x] Designed initial project structure
- [x] Outlined core modules organization
- [x] Planned API endpoints for token metrics

## IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Set up monorepo structure
- [ ] Extract blockchain connection utilities from page-token-frame
- [ ] Implement core price calculation services
- [ ] Set up TVL calculation services
- [ ] Create API endpoint for token prices

## TODO: Phase 1 - Core Token Metrics
- [ ] Implement data caching strategies
- [ ] Create simple React dashboard skeleton 
- [ ] Implement price chart components
- [ ] Add TVL visualization components
- [ ] Implement multi-chain comparison view
- [ ] Add basic wallet connection
- [ ] Deploy initial version to production

## TODO: Phase 2 - Dashboard Enhancements
- [ ] Implement historical data storage
- [ ] Create time-series charts for price history
- [ ] Add network distribution visualization
- [ ] Implement chain switching UI
- [ ] Create mobile responsive layouts
- [ ] Add theme support (light/dark mode)

## TODO: Phase 3 - Additional Features (from Whitepaper)
- [ ] Add basic market stats (market cap, supply info)
- [ ] Implement liquidity provider metrics
- [ ] Create API documentation page
- [ ] Implement API key management
- [ ] Add webhook notifications for significant price changes

## FUTURE PLANS (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Governance interface
- [ ] Content analytics
- [ ] Model Context Protocol integration
- [ ] Staking interface
- [ ] Creator tools integration

## NOTES
- Initially focusing on core token price functionality for the four chains
- Prioritizing reuse of existing code from page-token-frame
- Using Netlify Functions for serverless API endpoints
- Need to ensure proper error handling and fallbacks for RPC failures
- Dashboard should prominently display TVL-weighted average price
