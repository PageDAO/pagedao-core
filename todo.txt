# PageDAO Hub Implementation TODO List

## Important Implementation Guidelines

- All logic reused from existing .js files must be refactored into new .ts files with proper typing
- Follow consistent naming conventions across all packages
- Design API endpoints with clear, descriptive names that reflect their purpose
- Use these endpoint names consistently throughout the codebase (API implementation, core library, dashboard)
- Implement proper state management for the dashboard to ensure consistent data display
- Document all design decisions with clear rationales
- Prioritize maintainability and extensibility in all architectural decisions

## Current Progress (as of latest assessment)
